# Function `parseUrl`

## Description

The `parseUrl` function is a utility function that takes a URL as input and parses it to extract various components of the URL. It creates an anchor element (`<a>`) in the DOM and sets its `href` attribute to the provided URL. By doing so, the browser automatically parses the URL and populates the anchor element with information about the URL.

The function then returns an object containing the following properties extracted from the URL:

- `href`: The complete URL string, as resolved by the browser.
- `hash`: The URL fragment (hash) including the "#" symbol.
- `port`: The port number specified in the URL, if any.
- `host`: The host name and port number (if specified) in the format "hostname:port".
- `protocol`: The protocol (scheme) used in the URL, such as "http:", "https:", etc.
- `hostname`: The host name (domain) part of the URL.
- `pathname`: The path component of the URL, starting with a "/" character.
- `origin`: The origin of the URL, composed of the protocol, host, and port.

## Function Signature

```js
function parseUrl(url)
```

## Parameters

- `url`: The URL string that needs to be parsed.

## Return Value

The function returns an object containing various properties extracted from the provided URL.

## Example Usage
