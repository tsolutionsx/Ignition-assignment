# React To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do list application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and manage their to-do list efficiently.

## Features

### 1. Add Tasks

Easily add new tasks to your to-do list. The application provides a user-friendly input field where you can type in your task and hit the "Add Todo" button to add it to the list.

### 2. Mark Tasks as Completed

When you've completed a task, just click the checkbox next to it. The task will be marked as completed and displayed with a line-through text decoration to indicate its status.

### 3. Clean and Intuitive User Interface

The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it simple to use and understand. You can focus on managing your tasks without unnecessary distractions.

### 4. React Hooks for State Management

The To-Do list application utilizes React hooks for state management. This helps ensure the application maintains a clear and predictable state flow.

### 5. TypeScript for Improved Type Safety

TypeScript is used throughout the project to provide improved type safety. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and enhances the development experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-list.git
cd react-todo-list
```
````

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

```
src/
|-- components/
|   |-- TodoItem.tsx
|   |-- TodoList.tsx
|   |-- TodoForm.tsx
|
|-- types/
|   |-- todo.ts
|
|-- App.tsx
|-- index.tsx
```

- `components`: Contains reusable components used within the main `App` component.
- `types`: Holds TypeScript type declarations for the application.
- `App.tsx`: The main component that holds the state and manages the to-do list data.
- `index.tsx`: The entry point of the application, rendering the `App` component.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ReactDOM: A package for rendering React components in the DOM.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- @types/react, @types/react-dom: Type declarations for React and ReactDOM when using TypeScript.
- prop-types: Runtime type checking for React props (deprecated in favor of TypeScript types).
- Other standard dependencies (check `package.json` for the full list).
